# Web_Scraping_Project
Overview
/The aim of this project is to create a web scraping tool that can convert any web page to a PDF document. The tool should extract the text content from the web page and structure it properly in the PDF document. The tool should also include the relevant images from the web page and discard the unnecessary links and other elements. The tool should allow the user to download the PDF document as a file.
/Methodology
/The project consists of the following steps:
•	Step 1: Get the web page URL from the user input.
•	Step 2: Use a web scraping library such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to parse the HTML content of the web page.
•	Step 3: Use a text extraction library such as Newspaper or Boilerpipe to extract the main text content from the web page.
•	Step 4: Use a PDF generation library such as ReportLab or PyPDF2 to create a PDF document from the text content.
•	Step 5: Use an image extraction library such as PIL or OpenCV to extract the relevant images from the web page and embed them in the PDF document.
•	Step 6: Use a link removal library such as LinkExtractor or LinkFinder to remove the unnecessary links and other elements from the web page and the PDF document.
•	Step 7: Use a file handling library such as os or shutil to save the PDF document as a file and allow the user to download it.
Results
The project produces a PDF document that contains the text content and the relevant images from the web page. The PDF document does not contain any unnecessary links or other elements that are not related to the content. The PDF document is structured properly and has a clear layout. The user can download the PDF document as a file and view it offline or print it.
Conclusion
The project demonstrates the use of web scraping and PDF generation techniques to create a web page to PDF converter tool. The tool can be useful for various purposes such as saving web pages for later reading, archiving web pages, creating reports, and more. The tool can be further improved by adding more features such as customizing the PDF output, handling multiple web pages, and handling errors and exceptions.
